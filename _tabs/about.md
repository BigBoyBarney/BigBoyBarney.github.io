# Hi, I'm Barney! Welcome to my blog!

---

I mostly write about things that I find interesting or could be useful to someone in one way or another; be that gaming, art, language learning or some other obscure hobby. While I generally try to keep things educational and informative, not everything on the site intended for that purpose, as I like to write about my personal thoughts as well. However, the posts are clearly labeled as either one or the other, so worry not! 

I am what you would conventionally call a nerd, with a passion for games, fantasy and anime (here is my [AniList](https://anilist.co/user/BigBoyBarney/) if you're curious). I am fluent in English, German and Hungarian, and I'm conversational in French, so I like to think that I know what I'm talking about when it comes to language learning. Since I'm currently in the process of learning Japanese, language-related posts will tend to focus on that.

I hope you find something that interests you here!
